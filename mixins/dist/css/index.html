            <p> Our platform utilizes a modern data architecture model and boasts a range of in-built capabilities. With
                Bold BI, you can connect to your data, modify it to suit your specific needs, construct dashboards with
                relevant KPIs, and share these with your users to facilitate collaboration. Additionally, depending on
                your use case requirements, several other features can be enabled throughout these processes.</p>

                If you are using multi-tenant Bold BI server sites and looking for embedding the Designer in your application, then we recommend using the common embed secret instead of the separate embed secret for each site.

                Once you embedded the Bold BI application some links in the Bold BI application will open in a new tab instead of loading inside the above configured Iframe.
